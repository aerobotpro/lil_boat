# lil_boat
Its a lil boat but watch it float!
Targeting all architecture/OS!(cross platform c2)

## Just a Proof of Concept for now but I will finish and ultimately release :)

### Main idea is to controll a few machines via shell + upload custom compiled python modules for jobs like social botting + information gathering and further propagation via smtp!

### DDOS and banking are NOT the objective here!

#### NOT A QBOT!!!!!!!! PURE VANILLA :)
